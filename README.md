# addPayment
<h1>Add Payment Exercise Description</h1>
  <p>This was an exercise using a large JSON data file that contained all of the payments the city of Chicago made to venders from 2005 and 2010. 
<h1>Goal</h1>
The ojbective of the exercise was to add all payments. In order to acheive this goal the following needed to be accomplished: 
  <ul>
    <li> investigate the JSON data to locate the index of payments made to vendors</li>
    <li> create a callback function to execute the summation of all payments</li>
    <li> utilize callback function in the .forEach() method that used the created callback function as an argument</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h1>Future</h1>
  It would be interesting to correlate which department spent the most towards payments of vendors
    </p>
